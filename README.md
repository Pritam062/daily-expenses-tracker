Daily Expenses Tracker

 Introduction

Simple web application for users to monitor and track their daily expenses with ease. The project allows users to input their expenses by categorizing them and view reports of the amounts spent in an easy manner. The project will store the data locally on the browser's storage, meaning that you don't require a backend or database for this application, thus it is very light and can be accessed even offline.

Add New Expenses : You can easily add their day-to-day expenses specifying the amount, category, description, and date.

Expense Categories : This expense categories the costs or expenses incurred such as Food, Transport, Entertainment, etc., to track them.

Expense History : Gives a detailed history of all recorded expenses that can be sorted and filtered.

Summary Report : Enables you to generate reports on how much was spent in total over periods of days, weeks, or months.

Charts & Vizuals - Display amount of spending money in pie charts and bar graph, easy to understand.

Local Storage : The expense data is stored in the browser's local storage directly so it works offline too even if you are not connected online.

 Technology Used

- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Plain JS or your preferred library / framework: React/Vue)
  
- Local Storage: Data will be stored in the `localStorage` API of the browser, so no need for a back-end server.
  
Charting: Expenses are charted using Chart.js or D3.js



Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Track your daily expenses by entering the amount, category, description, and date.
3. View the added expenses in the history section.
4. Create graphic reports of your spending pattern.
5. All of your data will be saved on your browser locally and even after you refresh pages, it is still kept there.



* Limitations

Data is persisted in local storage inside the browser meaning it is tied to the device. If you clear the browser data, all of the saved expenses are gone
This build doesn't support multi-user as it does not have a backend.
